This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

dog | bird | cat
----|------|----
`r rr[1,2]` | foo  | foo
bar | bar  | bar
baz | baz  | baz


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
